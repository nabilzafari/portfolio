My Photography Background
==========================

My name is Nabil Zafari , I was born and grown up in Quetta city capital of province Balochistan located in west of Pakistan. My interest for photography started when one of my close friend (Basit) bought a DSLR camera in 2013. Basit was elder then me and had his independant income. We use to go for photography walk and i used to help him while covering different events. Basit was not just a friend but he was my first photography teacher, he was the one who taught me how to turn on the DSLR and how to click. After few months our photography community spreads and we got more friends having DSLR. Few years later i moved to Sweden and wanted to continue my photography passion and i bought my own camera. I was at 9th grade when i used to go for daily photography walks. I started to publish my shots on social media and a newspaper agency contact me for an interview about my passion.
